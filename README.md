learn
=====

An web application to access educational content on different levels of complexity. See [the wiki](https://github.com/mfsch/learn/wiki) for more information on the concept, principles and implementation considerations.

The drafts directory contains older drafts for such an application. In the README.md files of these folders, there is a link to view those drafts on-line via GitHub.

The application is currently still in the design phase. It might take a while until a usable prototype is available.
