About this draft
================

This draft has been created by me (Manuel Schmid) as part of a school project in fall 2012. 
It was built as a web application using the Pyramid framework, a MongoDB database and some 
other Python libraries (pygments, markdown).

The version found in this directory is static and HTML+CSS only. It is meant to serve as a 
basis for further discussions and should give an impression of the basic ideas. If requested,
I can provide the code for the Pyramid application as well.
