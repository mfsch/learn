About this draft
================

This draft has been created by me (Manuel Schmid) as part of a school project in fall 2012. It was built as a web application using the Pyramid framework, a MongoDB database and some other Python libraries (pygments, markdown).

The version found in this directory is static and HTML+CSS only. It is meant to serve as a basis for further discussions and should give an impression of the basic ideas.
