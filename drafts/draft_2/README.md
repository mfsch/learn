About this draft
================

Another, later, draft by me (Manuel Schmid), this time
static only and only one page. It is built on top of the
HTML5 Boilerplate project and provides basic responsive
capabilities, i.e. the design changes based on the width
of the viewport.

Again, it is provided as a basis for discussion and not
as a proposal for a final design. It can be accessed on
GitHub [from here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://raw.github.com/mfsch/learn/master/drafts/draft_2/index.html).
